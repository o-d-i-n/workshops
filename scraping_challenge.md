# Scraping Challenge
We've provided notebooks for a quick tutorial on scraping and basics of python in the folder Intro_To_Python_And_Web_Scraping.

This week's challenge (duration is one week) is to make something creative based on web scraping. It would be great if your scraping app is a little flexible and user-interactive (can change parameters to fetch different data).

**Gotta Scrap'em All :D**
